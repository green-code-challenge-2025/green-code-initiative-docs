= Hello! We are pleased to see you here 👋
:gci-github-organization: https://github.com/green-code-initiative

Please read
common link:{gci-github-organization}/creedengo-common/blob/main/doc/CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING.md]
in `creedengo-common` repository first.\
Also check the link:{gci-github-organization}/creedengo-common/blob/main/doc/starter-pack.md[starter-pack] to
have the basic information before starting.

== Structure

The documentation contains some essential files:

* 📄 `antora-playbook.yml` defines the repos to get information from and the way the documentation should be built;
* 📁 `docs` contains some content that is included as part of the documentation itself.

== Requirements

* Node.js 18.x or newer
* Knowledge of https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] and fundamentals of https://asciidoctor.org/[Antora]

== Installation

. Clone the Git repository
. Run `npm install`
. You are good to go! 🚀
** `npm run build` -> generates the website inside the `build/site` directory (`build/site/index.html` can be open in a web browser).
** `npm run clean` -> removes the `build` directory (use to make sure your documentation doesn't include remainders from previous builds).

== What else?

You should be ready to open a PR on GitHub with all your code!

This is the end of this guide, thank you for reading this far and contributing to the project 🙏.
